# Unified Cloud Analytics: Integrating SAP S/4HANA and BigQuery into Snowflake with Snowsight Dashboards

## 🎯 Project Goal
Build a proof-of-concept that simulates how a business integrates enterprise data from SAP S/4HANA and user-generated feedback from BigQuery into Snowflake for centralized analytics and AI insights using Snowsight dashboards.

This showcases:
- SAP + GCP + Snowflake integration
- Data modeling and warehousing
- Cloud-native AI capabilities (optional)
- Dashboarding with Snowflake’s built-in tools

## 🧱 Architecture Overview

### ✅ Key Components:
- **SAP S/4HANA Cloud**  
  Source of structured enterprise data (e.g. Sales Orders, Customers)
- **Google BigQuery (via Cloud Storage)**  
  Source of user comments in .txt format (uploaded from GCS)
- **Snowflake**  
  Centralized Data Warehouse for ingestion, modeling, and analytics
- **Snowsight Dashboards**  
  Visualization layer with KPIs, AI insights (if enabled)

## 📦 Tools & Accounts Required
| Platform | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| SAP S/4HANA Cloud | Export demo sales/finance data |
| Google Cloud (BigQuery + GCS) | Load user comments from a .txt file |
| Snowflake | Central data warehouse + dashboards |
---

## 🔄 Data Sources & Flow
| Source | Details |
|--------|---------|
| SAP S/4HANA | Exported sample Sales Order/Customer data (CSV) |
| BigQuery | User feedback/comments stored in a .txt file in GCS and scheduled to load into BigQuery |
| Destination | Both data sources are loaded into Snowflake for unified analytics |

## 🔨 Project Steps

### 🟠 Phase 1: Setup (Week 1)
1. Register for:
   - SAP S/4HANA Cloud
   - Snowflake
   - Google Cloud
2. Create a simple `user_comments.txt` file (simulate customer feedback)

### 🟡 Phase 2: Data Extraction & Loading (Week 1–2)
**From SAP:**
- Export sample sales/customer CSV files from trial system
- Clean and rename columns for standardization

**From BigQuery:**
- Upload `user_comments.txt` to Google Cloud Storage
- Create a scheduled transfer or manually load into BigQuery
- Export data to Snowflake via CSV or connect Snowflake directly via external stage or connector

### 🟢 Phase 3: Data Load into Snowflake
- Use `PUT` and `COPY INTO` for SAP data
- Create staging and normalized tables for both data sources
- Use Snowflake's scripting or UI for data transformation

### 🔵 Phase 4: Analytics & Dashboards in Snowflake
Create models and views to:
- Join customer data with feedback
- Analyze trends in regions/products
- Summarize feedback (positive, negative) by product line

Build Snowsight Dashboards to visualize:
- KPIs (sales, feedback volume, sentiment summary)
- Line/bar charts for trends
- Tables with drill-downs

## 🧠 Optional: Add AI Layer
Use Snowflake Cortex (Forecast or Document AI) to:
- Predict future sales from SAP data
- Summarize or classify user comments (if enough samples)
