review/summary: Great buy!
review/text: I purchased a different jacket when I first got my motorcycle; but I only used it for about six months before needing a new one. In my local shop; they had no plus-sized women's jackets; so I was wearing a men's jacket; and the plates weren't in good places to be protective in case of an accident. This jacket runs true to size; and seems more durable than the other brand of jacket I had (Joe Rocket). The two separate zip-out liners are very convenient and easy. I am very happy with the fit and quality. I ride about two hours a day; on the interstate; and my old jacket started to fray at certain seams after only a month or so. I have had this one for over a month; and there are no signs of wear. In addition; the jacket is comfortable from 95 degrees down to 50 degrees (with appropriate clothing underneath; of course). It may work in even colder weather; but I haven't ridden in anything colder than 50. Overall; I'm really; really pleased with this purchase!

review/summary: Great jacket for the money
review/text: This jacket met every expectation and more. Although heavy; it is comfortable and can be snugged down for a more "tailored" fit. If anything could be a "con" its the zippers...when the linings are out; there are a lot of zippers exposed and I often try to zip the wrong ones! The liners are great....keep you dry; keep off the wind; or keep you warm. I have no complaints. The jacket may be short for some people...but I'm very short-waisted and it fits me perfect. I sized up 1 size and it is quite comfortable.

review/text: This is a cute little kit that doesn't take up a lot of space; but it has everything you might need in case of an car accident. This would make a great gift for someone who has just gotten their first car.

review/summary: Doesn't Fit
review/text: I ordered this DashMat for a specific vehicle; it was not the correct mat. I returned the original one and they sent me an exact duplicate of the wrong mat. I can't seem to get the correct one and therefore it sits in a box!!!!!!
